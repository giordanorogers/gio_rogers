At some point, math and writing became cooler than music to me.
My musician dreams felt hedonic and corrupt.
Every morning I would wake up and groan over my reality.
It was unbearable how pointless my life had become.
The illusion I'd steeped myself in was gone.
I felt ugly and naked.
And the world of logic and abstraction became an escape.
