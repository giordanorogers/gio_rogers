The real value of what I might be able to get out of this affair with mathematics feels just beyond the scope of what I can put in words.
Simply, the ability to move through life truthfully -- free from bias.
I want to kill this pattern of mistakes and regret.
Why and how is math relevant to that?
Well, look at what it's allowed us to engineer for ourselves.
Our civilization is enabled by engineering, which is enabled by math.
Is our civilization free from mistakes and regret? No.
Is our civilization more competent? Yes.
Does competence necessarily prevent mistakes? No.
How do you prevent mistakes and regret?
Philosophy comes to mind.
But philosophy is non-constructive.
99% of philosophy is bias in the limit.
Only 1% is truth.
If mathematics can be a vehicle for balancing that proportion, that would be a good thing.
