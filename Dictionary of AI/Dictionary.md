## E

encoder-decoder: A set techniques that try to transform the highly nonlinear manifold on which the data lies (e.g., in pixel or vector space) into a simpler latent space that can be sampled from, so that it is likely that any point in the latent space is the representation of a well-formed image.

## P

probability-density function: A function p(x) that represents the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within different intervalsd, with the integral of p(x) over the entire range of possible values being equal to 1.

## R

representation learning: Instead of trying to model the high-dimensional sample space directly, we describe each observation in the training set using some lower-dimensional latent space and then learn a mapping function that can take a point in the latent space and map it to a point in the original domain. 

## S

sample space: The complete set of all values an observation x can take.
